===========================================

There is news display which allows the user display news from a specified
source on the big screen, image display which allows the user to display an image galary of their choosing, 
video displayer which allows the user to display a video from youtube
or microsoft stream, as well as a page display that can display a page created using omnia sharepoint.

News Display
-------------------------------------------

In order to access the news settings, enter edit mode once again, and this time click on the cog wheel 
in the full screen component that you placed in your page.
  
Big Picture allows the user to display news from a provided news center that is connected to the user's intranet. 
The user can also choose the period of which news will be displaye, how the articles will be ordered, the limit of the amounts of articles at a time and the priority.

Images Display
-------------------------------------------

Images display is found in the second tab and allows the user to link an image folder that has images uploaded to the sharepoint website, and have these images displayed
in a specific order and at specific speed.

Video Display
-------------------------------------------

Video display can be found in the third tab that is called Videos Settings where the user can input a URL link to a youtube video or a microsoft stream. 

We recommend the use of youtube over microsoft as it reduces the chances of performance issues when this functionality is used on an older device 
that might have less performance capabilities. In order to display a video setting, make sure to enter a valid youtube url in the video location field. An example of a valid url is:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhC5PtMWNVo.

Video settings provides the option to include a video title, a specific start time and end time of the video as well as the ability to add multiple videos. 

Page Display
-------------------------------------------

Page display can be found in the fourth tabe Pages settings, where the user can select one or multiple webpages to be displayed.

Note that the pages do not have to be created by the user, but the user needs to have acess to view them in order to use them for Big Picture.
